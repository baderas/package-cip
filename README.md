# package-cip
This script packages VMware Client Integration Plugin for Debian

You need to edit $srcdir, $pkgdir and $bundle inside package_cip.sh before you can run ./package_cip.sh.

Only tested on Debian Jessie amd64 with CIP Version 5.5.0 x86_64.

Warning: This script worked for me but is kind of raw and unpolished. Use at your own risk!
